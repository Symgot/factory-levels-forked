# Advanced Settings
factory-levels-max-level-tier-1=Max Level for Tier 1 Machines
factory-levels-max-level-tier-2=Max Level for Tier 2 Machines
factory-levels-max-level-tier-3=Max Level for Tier 3 Machines
factory-levels-check-interval=Machine Check Interval (Ticks)
factory-levels-machines-per-check=Machines per Tick Check
factory-levels-base-requirement=Base Requirement for Level 1
factory-levels-debug-mode=Enable Debug Mode
factory-levels-enable-assembler-leveling=Enable Assembler Leveling
factory-levels-enable-furnace-leveling=Enable Furnace Leveling
factory-levels-enable-refinery-leveling=Enable Refinery Leveling

[mod-setting-description]
factory-levels-enable-productivity-bonus=Factories and furnaces get a small productivity bonus on level up
factory-levels-enable-quality-bonus=Factories receive quality bonuses on level up
factory-levels-enable-recycler-leveling=Should Recyclers level up? There is currently an issue where you need to completely clear the inventory of the recycler after levelup (can be automated easily)
factory-levels-enable-module-bonus=Factories and furnaces get additional module slot at level 20 (Assembler 1) and 40 (Assembler 2) and 30 and 60 (Assembler 3)
factory-levels-enable-speed-bonus=Factories and furnaces get a crafting speed bonus on level up
factory-levels-enable-energy-usage=Factories and furnaces use more energy with each level
factory-levels-enable-emissions=Factories and furnaces emit even more per energy used when leveling up
factory-levels-exponent=Default: 3, lower is faster, higher is slower (Default reaches level 100 at 1 million items)
factory-levels-disable-mod=Disables mod for safe removal. This immediately scans the entire factory and downgrades ALL machines to their base machine.

# Advanced Settings Descriptions
factory-levels-max-level-tier-1=Maximum level for Tier 1 machines (Assembler 1, Stone Furnace, etc.). Default: 25
factory-levels-max-level-tier-2=Maximum level for Tier 2 machines (Assembler 2, Electric Furnace 2, etc.). Default: 50
factory-levels-max-level-tier-3=Maximum level for Tier 3 machines (Assembler 3, Electric Furnace, etc.). Default: 100
factory-levels-check-interval=How often (in ticks) the mod checks machines for upgrades. Lower = more frequent checks, higher performance impact. Default: 6
factory-levels-machines-per-check=Number of machines checked per tick interval. Higher = faster leveling, higher performance impact. Default: 100
factory-levels-base-requirement=Base number of items required for the first level. Affects the entire leveling curve. Default: 1
factory-levels-debug-mode=Shows debug messages about level requirements when exponent changes. Default: Off
factory-levels-enable-assembler-leveling=Allow assembling machines to level up. Default: On
factory-levels-enable-furnace-leveling=Allow furnaces and smelters to level up. Default: On
factory-levels-enable-refinery-leveling=Allow chemical plants, refineries, and centrifuges to level up. Default: On
